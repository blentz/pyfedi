"""`send_post` -- the Celery-path builder and deliverer of an ActivityPub Page.

`app/shared/tasks/pages.py:88-368`. This is the second of two Page builders in
the codebase; the other is `post_to_page` (app/activitypub/util.py:132-219),
reached from the outbox collection view at app/activitypub/routes.py:2033. They
are near-twins and their disagreements are findings D298, D299 and D300.

ENTRY is a direct call. `send_post(post_id, edit=False, session=None)` has no
usable default for `session` -- :89 is `session.query(Post).get(post_id)` -- so
every test here passes `db.session` explicitly.

FOUR EARLY RETURNS stand between entry and the builder at :175, and a test that
wants to reach the builder must clear all four:

  :149-150  `if not community.instance.online(): return`
  :153-154  `if community.local_only or community.private: return`
  :156-158  a CommunityBan row for (user, community)
  :159-161  a remote community whose instance the user blocked, or that is banned

`Instance.online()` is `not (self.dormant or self.gone_forever)`, and both
columns default False (app/models.py:98, :100), so a factory instance is online
without help.

NOTE ON :153, because sub-project 18 relied on the opposite. Setting
`community.local_only = True` does NOT merely skip delivery -- it returns at
:154 before the builder runs at all. That is also why the false arms of :267
and :330 (`if not community.local_only:`) are UNREACHABLE: `community` is bound
once at :91 and never reassigned, so by :267 the flag is always falsy. Those two
arms are registered as unreachable rather than chased.

STOPPING BEFORE THE NETWORK. :336-338 is
`followers = ...; if not followers: return`. A post whose author has no inward
UserFollower rows ends the function there. Combined with a local community that
has no following_instances(), the entire builder runs with zero outbound
requests, and no `http_mock` is needed. Tests that DO reach delivery must give
the sender real keys (`make_user(..., with_keys=True)`), because signing calls
`.encode()` on the private key.

MENTIONS ARE SILENTLY SKIPPED. `search_for_user` (app/user/utils.py:85) is
called at :106 and :112, each inside a bare `except: pass` (:107-108, :113-114).
So a test asserting that a mention produced no notification cannot distinguish
"correctly skipped" from "crashed and swallowed" -- pin the reason, not the
absence.
