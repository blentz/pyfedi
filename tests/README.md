# Tests

Run everything:

    ./run_tests.sh

Run a subset — arguments pass straight through to pytest:

    ./run_tests.sh tests/test_boost_storage.py -v

Dispose of the containers when you are done:

    ./run_tests.sh --down

## How it works

`run_tests.sh` starts the Postgres and Redis in `compose.test.yaml` with
podman-compose, waits for Postgres to accept connections, applies migrations, and
runs pytest. Container data lives in tmpfs, so nothing survives `--down` and no
state leaks between runs.

Neither service publishes a host port. `test-runner` reaches them over the compose
network by name, so none is needed — and publishing one would stop two checkouts of
this repo (a git worktree, for instance) from running tests at the same time, since
the second stack could not bind the port. To inspect a running test database:

    podman-compose -f compose.test.yaml exec test-db psql -U pyfedi pyfedi_test
    podman-compose -f compose.test.yaml exec test-redis redis-cli

## Two things that will otherwise waste your time

**`--down` makes the next run slow.** It destroys the tmpfs volume, so the next
run replays all ~269 migrations against an empty database instead of the usual
no-op. Use it when you are finished, not between runs.

**podman-compose names the project after the directory.** A second checkout gets a
separate stack, and `./run_tests.sh --down` only stops the stack belonging to the
directory you run it from. If a run stalls waiting for Postgres, check `podman ps`
for another checkout's containers and stop that stack from its own directory.

Environment comes from `.env.test`, exported before pytest starts. That matters
because `app/__init__.py` builds the rate limiter and Celery app from `Config` at
import time, so a `TestConfig` attribute would be set too late. `config.py` calls
`load_dotenv('.env')`, which does not override already-exported variables, so this
coexists with your dev `.env`.

The schema comes from `flask db upgrade`, not `db.create_all()`, because
SQLAlchemy-Searchable triggers and several indexes are created by migrations and
would otherwise be missing — tests would exercise a different schema than
production.

## Running pytest directly

There is no host Python environment for this repo, so pytest always runs inside
the `test-runner` container:

    podman-compose -f compose.test.yaml exec -T test-runner pytest tests/test_microblog_announce.py -v

Pure-function tests need no database, but they do need the environment — importing
`app.utils` pulls in `config.py`, which reads `SERVER_NAME` at import time and
raises without it. `test-runner` gets that environment from `.env.test`.

Database-backed tests skip, rather than fail, when `TEST_DATABASE_URL` is unset.

**Warning:** the `db_session` fixture truncates every table after each test.
`conftest.py`'s `is_disposable_database_url()` refuses to run unless the database
name (the last "/"-separated path segment, with any `?query`/`#fragment` stripped)
ends with `_test` — a bare substring match on "test" is not enough, since that
would also accept real database names like `attestation` or a URL whose query
string merely mentions "test". Do not defeat that guard. `tests/test_conftest_guard.py`
covers it.

`tests/test_activitypub_util.py` predates this setup. It needs live network access
and a hardcoded username, and is excluded from the standard run.

## Coverage

`app/request_hooks.py` is held at 100% branch coverage:

    ./run_tests.sh tests/ -q --ignore=tests/test_activitypub_util.py \
        --cov=app.request_hooks --cov-branch --cov-report=term-missing --cov-fail-under=100

Use the dotted module form (`--cov=app.request_hooks`), not a file path
(`--cov=app/request_hooks.py`). The file-path form reports `Module
app/request_hooks.py was never imported` and measures 0% in this environment
(pytest-cov against pytest 9.1.1 / coverage.py 7.15.4, no pyproject.toml /
pytest.ini / .coveragerc in this repo) even though the module is plainly
imported and exercised -- silently failing the gate for the wrong reason.

Branch coverage, not just line coverage: `after_request` is dense with
conditionals, and line coverage alone reports 100% while leaving whole branches
unexercised.

Coverage is a floor, not a target. A test that executes a line without asserting
anything raises the number and catches nothing.

## Known noise

Two things show up in normal runs that are not bugs in this setup and do not
need re-investigating:

- Two `DeprecationWarning`s from `ldap3`/`pyasn1` (`tagMap`/`typeMap` are
  deprecated) appear in every pytest run. They come from a transitive
  dependency pulled in by LDAP support, unrelated to this test setup.
- `./run_tests.sh --down` logs `StopSignal SIGTERM failed to stop container
  ...test-runner... resorting to SIGKILL`. `test-runner` idles on
  `sleep infinity`, which does not trap `SIGTERM`, so compose falls back to
  `SIGKILL` after its timeout. Cosmetic — the container still stops and no
  state persists (tmpfs).
