# Tests

Run everything:

    ./run_tests.sh

Run a subset — arguments pass straight through to pytest:

    ./run_tests.sh tests/test_boost_storage.py -v

Dispose of the containers when you are done:

    ./run_tests.sh --down

## How it works

`run_tests.sh` starts the Postgres and Redis in `compose.test.yaml` with
podman-compose, waits for Postgres to accept connections, applies migrations, and
runs pytest. Container data lives in tmpfs on ports 5433 and 6380, so the test
stack neither collides with nor outlives the dev stack in `compose.dev.yaml`.

Environment comes from `.env.test`, exported before pytest starts. That matters
because `app/__init__.py` builds the rate limiter and Celery app from `Config` at
import time, so a `TestConfig` attribute would be set too late. `config.py` calls
`load_dotenv('.env')`, which does not override already-exported variables, so this
coexists with your dev `.env`.

The schema comes from `flask db upgrade`, not `db.create_all()`, because
SQLAlchemy-Searchable triggers and several indexes are created by migrations and
would otherwise be missing — tests would exercise a different schema than
production.

## Running pytest directly

There is no host Python environment for this repo, so pytest always runs inside
the `test-runner` container:

    podman-compose -f compose.test.yaml exec -T test-runner pytest tests/test_microblog_announce.py -v

Pure-function tests need no database, but they do need the environment — importing
`app.utils` pulls in `config.py`, which reads `SERVER_NAME` at import time and
raises without it. `test-runner` gets that environment from `.env.test`.

Database-backed tests skip, rather than fail, when `TEST_DATABASE_URL` is unset.

**Warning:** the `db_session` fixture truncates every table after each test.
`conftest.py`'s `is_disposable_database_url()` refuses to run unless the database
name (the last "/"-separated path segment, with any `?query`/`#fragment` stripped)
ends with `_test` — a bare substring match on "test" is not enough, since that
would also accept real database names like `attestation` or a URL whose query
string merely mentions "test". Do not defeat that guard. `tests/test_conftest_guard.py`
covers it.

`tests/test_activitypub_util.py` predates this setup. It needs live network access
and a hardcoded username, and is excluded from the standard run.

## Known noise

Two things show up in normal runs that are not bugs in this setup and do not
need re-investigating:

- Two `DeprecationWarning`s from `ldap3`/`pyasn1` (`tagMap`/`typeMap` are
  deprecated) appear in every pytest run. They come from a transitive
  dependency pulled in by LDAP support, unrelated to this test setup.
- `./run_tests.sh --down` logs `StopSignal SIGTERM failed to stop container
  ...test-runner... resorting to SIGKILL`. `test-runner` idles on
  `sleep infinity`, which does not trap `SIGTERM`, so compose falls back to
  `SIGKILL` after its timeout. Cosmetic — the container still stops and no
  state persists (tmpfs).
